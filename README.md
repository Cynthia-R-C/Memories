_A Story Game by Cynthia-R-C_

**Overview**

There are 2 possible types of deaths and 3 possible endings. Only one ending is the True Ending. This is based on my novel When Night Falls, and you are playing as my main character who lost his memories. You do NOT need to have read the novel to play this game - this game serves more as a kind of "trailer" for my novel. The story takes place in ancient China.
If you are confused, that is OK. You are supposed to learn more about where you are and what is happening as you play.

**Directions**

Press enter or make a choice when there is an arrow in front of the message, e.g. "> Look around ".
Read the dialogue _carefully_ and _think outside the box_.

**Novel**

_(In case you want to read the story)_
Note that the novel is not yet fully written.
